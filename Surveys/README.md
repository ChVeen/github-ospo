# GitHub OSPO-Survey
Survey questions we've used at GitHub's Open Source Programs Office (OSPO).

**Survey Goal**: To evaluate and understand GitHub’s involvement in open source activities to determine how these align and contribute to our strategic business objectives. Information gathered will be utilized to prioritize programs to support Hubber’s open source participation and success in open source.

## **Categories**
Questions are grouped by topic area, and then the survey questions, which we welcome contributions to if you use them and identify ways of improving. Beneath each topic is the list of questions.
